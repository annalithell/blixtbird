## Configuration

Fenics uses a `config.yaml` file to manage simulation parameters. Proper configuration ensures that simulations run as intended with the desired settings.
    
### Parameters in `config.yaml`
    
Below is an explanation of the primary parameters you can configure:
    
```yaml
simulations:
  simulation1:
    rounds: 3                   # Number of training rounds
    epochs: 1                   # Number of epochs per round
    num_nodes: 5                # Total number of nodes in the simulation
    num_attackers: 0            # Number of attacker nodes
    attacker_nodes: []          # Specific nodes designated as attackers
    attacks: []                 # Types of attacks to simulate
    use_attackers: false        # Flag to enable or disable attacker simulation
    participation_rate: 0.6     # Fraction of nodes participating each round
    topology: fully_connected   # Network topology type
    topology_file: null         # Path to a custom topology edge list file
    max_attacks: null           # Maximum number of attacks an attacker can perform
    gossip_steps: 3             # Number of gossiping steps during aggregation
    protocol: gossip            # Aggregation protocol ('gossip' or 'neighboring')
    alpha: 0.5                  # Dirichlet distribution parameter for data partitioning
    model_type: cnn             # Model type to use ('cnn', 'mlp', or custom)
```
    
**Parameter Descriptions:**
    
- **`rounds`**: Total number of training rounds to execute.
- **`epochs`**: Number of training epochs each node performs per round.
- **`num_nodes`**: Total number of participating nodes in the simulation.
- **`num_attackers`**: Number of nodes designated as attackers.
- **`attacker_nodes`**: List of specific node IDs to act as attackers. Overrides `num_attackers` if provided.
- **`attacks`**: Types of attacks to simulate (e.g., 'delay', 'poison'). Define the attack strategies you want to test.
- **`use_attackers`**: Boolean flag to enable (`true`) or disable (`false`) attacker simulations.
- **`participation_rate`**: Fraction of nodes selected to participate in each round. For example, `0.6` means 60% of nodes are selected each round.
- **`topology`**: Defines the network topology. Common options include:
  - `fully_connected`: Every node is connected to every other node.
  - `ring`: Nodes are connected in a ring structure.
  - `random`: Random graph with probabilistic connections.
  - `custom`: Use a custom topology defined in an edge list file.
- **`topology_file`**: Path to a custom topology edge list file. Required if `topology` is set to `custom`.
- **`max_attacks`**: Maximum number of attacks an attacker node can perform throughout the simulation.
- **`gossip_steps`**: Number of gossiping steps to perform during the aggregation phase.
- **`protocol`**: Communication protocol to use. Options:
  - `gossip`: Nodes exchange updates in a gossip manner.
  - `neighboring`: Nodes exchange updates with their immediate neighbors.
- **`alpha`**: Parameter for the Dirichlet distribution used in data partitioning among nodes.
- **`model_type`**: Type of model to use. Options:
  - `cnn`: Convolutional Neural Network (default).
  - `mlp`: Multi-Layer Perceptron.
  - Custom models can be registered and used.
    
### Setting Up `topology.edgelist`
    
When using a **custom network topology**, you need to define the connections between nodes in an edge list file. Here's how to set it up:
    
1. **Create the Edge List File:**
    
    - **Filename:** `topology.edgelist` (or any name of your choice)
    - **Format:** Each line represents an undirected edge between two nodes, specified by their node IDs separated by a space.
    
    **Example `topology.edgelist`:**
    
    ```
    0 1
    1 2
    1 4
    2 3
    3 5
    3 6
    4 5
    5 6
    5 7
    7 8
    8 9
    ```
    
    **Explanation:**
    - Node `0` is connected to Node `1`.
    - Node `1` is connected to Nodes `0`, `2`, and `4`.
    - And so on...
    
2. **Place the Edge List File:**
    
    Save the `topology.edgelist` file in a directory accessible to your project. For example, you can place it in the root directory of your project.
    
3. **Configure `config.yaml` to Use the Custom Topology:**
    
    Update the `config.yaml` to reference your custom edge list file.
    
    ```yaml
    simulations:
      simulation1:
        # Other parameters...
        topology: custom
        topology_file: path/to/your/topology.edgelist
    ```
4. **Understanding the `topology.edgelist`:**
    
    - **Node IDs:** Ensure that node IDs in the edge list start from `0` and are consecutive integers up to `num_nodes - 1`.
    - **Undirected Edges:** Each connection is bidirectional. If you want Node `0` connected to Node `1`, you only need to specify `0 1`. There's no need to add `1 0`.

## Usage
    
Fenics provides a command-line interface called **Fenics Shell** to interact with the simulator. Below are instructions on how to set up and run simulations.
    
### Using the Fenics Shell
    
1. **Launch the Fenics Shell:**
    
    ```bash
    fenics
    ```
    
    **Sample Output:**
    
    ```
       ______              _            
      |  ____|            (_)           
      | |__ ___ _ __  ___ _  ___ ___ 
      |  __/ _ \ '_ \/ __| |/ __/ __|
      | | |  __/ | | \__ \ | (__\__ \
      |_|  \___|_| |_|___/_|\___|___/
                                        
    Welcome to Fenics Shell! Type 'help' to see available commands.
    Fenics> 
    ```
    
2. **Setup the Simulation Environment:**
    
    Use the `setup` command to initialize simulation parameters.
    
    - **Using Direct Parameters:**
    
      ```bash
      setup --rounds 3 --epochs 1 --topology fully_connected --participation_rate 0.6 --protocol gossip --num_nodes 5 --alpha 0.5
      ```
    
    - **Using a Configuration File:**
    
      ```bash
      setup --config config.yaml --simulation_name simulation1
      ```
    
      **Explanation:**
      - **`--config`**: Specifies the path to the `config.yaml` file.
      - **`--simulation_name`**: Identifies which simulation parameters to load from the configuration file.
    
3. **Run the Simulation:**
    
    After setup, execute the simulation using the `run` command.
    
    ```bash
    run
    ```
    
    **Sample Output:**
    
    ```
    Final Simulation Arguments:
    Rounds: 3
    Epochs: 1
    Topology: fully_connected
    Participation rate: 0.6
    Protocol: gossip
    Num nodes: 5
    Alpha: 0.5
    
    Starting simulation...
    Simulation Progress: 100%|██████████████████████████████████████████████████████████| 3/3 [00:01<00:00, 2.50round/s, CPU Usage: 55%]
    
    Simulation completed successfully. Check the 'results' directory for outputs.
    ```
    
    **Explanation:**
    - **Progress Bar:** A real-time progress bar displays the simulation's progress, showing the percentage completed and the latest CPU usage.
    - **Logs and Plots:** Detailed logs and visual plots are saved in the `results` directory.
    
4. **Exit the Fenics Shell:**
    
    Use the `exit` or `quit` command to exit.
    
    ```bash
    exit
    ```
    
### Running with Command-Line Arguments
    
Alternatively, you can run simulations directly without entering the Fenics Shell by passing commands as arguments.

```bash
fenics setup --config config.yaml --simulation_name simulation1 && fenics run
```
    
**Note:** This approach sequentially executes the `setup` and `run` commands.

## Extending Fenics

Fenics is designed to be modular and extensible. You can easily add custom implementations for various components without modifying the core code.

### Adding Custom Topologies

1. Create a new Python file in the `fenics/topology/` directory:

```python
# fenics/topology/my_topology.py
from fenics.topology import TopologyBase, TopologyFactory
import networkx as nx

class MyTopology(TopologyBase):
    def __init__(self, num_nodes, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(num_nodes)
        # Additional initialization if needed
        
    def build(self):
        # Implement your topology building logic
        G = nx.Graph()
        # Add nodes and edges
        return G

# Register the topology
TopologyFactory.register_topology('my_topology', MyTopology)
```

2. Import your file and use it:

```python
import fenics.topology.my_topology

# Use in configuration
# topology: my_topology
```

### Adding Custom Models

from fenics.models import ModelBase, ModelFactory

class MyModel(ModelBase):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        # Define your model architecture
        
    def forward(self, x):
        # Implement forward pass
        return x

# Register the model
ModelFactory.register_model('my_model', MyModel)
```

2. Import your file and use it:

```python
import fenics.models.my_model

import random
from typing import List, Optional
import logging

def select_clients_my_strategy(nodes: List[int], 
                              num_participants: int, 
                              logger: Optional[logging.Logger] = None) -> List[int]:
    """Custom selection strategy."""
    logger = logger or logging.getLogger()
    # Implement your selection logic
    return selected_nodes
```

2. Register and use it:

```python
from fenics.client_selection.factory import SelectionFactory
from fenics.client_selection.strategies.my_strategy import select_clients_my_strategy

# Register the strategy
SelectionFactory.register_strategy('my_strategy', select_clients_my_strategy)
```

### Adding Custom Attack Types

1. Create a new Python file in the `fenics/attack/attack_types/` directory:

```python
# fenics/attack/attack_types/my_attack.py
from fenics.attack.attack_types.base import Attack
from fenics.attack.attack_factory import AttackFactory

class MyAttack(Attack):
    def __init__(self, node_id, logger=None):
        super().__init__(node_id, logger)
        
    def execute(self, model):
        # Implement your attack logic
        return model.state_dict()

# Register the attack
AttackFactory.register_attack('my_attack', MyAttack)
```

2. Import and use your attack:

```python
import fenics.attack.attack_types.my_attack

# Use in configuration
# attacks: [my_attack]
```

### Adding Custom Aggregation Strategies

1. Create a new Python file in the `fenics/aggregation/` directory:

```python
# fenics/aggregation/my_strategy.py
import torch
from fenics.aggregation.base import AggregationStrategy
from fenics.aggregation.factory import AggregationFactory

class MyAggregationStrategy(AggregationStrategy):
    def aggregate(self, models_state_dicts, data_sizes):
        # Implement your aggregation logic
        return aggregated_state_dict

# Register the strategy
AggregationFactory.register_strategy('my_aggregation', MyAggregationStrategy)
```

2. Import and use your strategy:

```python
import fenics.aggregation.my_strategy

# Use in your code
agg_strategy = AggregationFactory.get_strategy('my_aggregation')
```

### Adding Custom Communication Protocols

1. Create a new Python file in the `fenics/communication/` directory:

```python
# fenics/communication/my_protocol.py
from fenics.communication.base import CommunicationProtocol
from fenics.communication.factory import ProtocolFactory

class MyProtocol(CommunicationProtocol):
    def exchange(self, nodes, G, local_models, executor):
        # Implement your exchange logic
        pass

# Register the protocol
ProtocolFactory.register_protocol('my_protocol', MyProtocol)
```

2. Import and use your protocol:

```python
import fenics.communication.my_protocol

# Use in configuration
# protocol: my_protocol
```

---

## Examples

Here's a step-by-step example to demonstrate how to set up and run a simulation using a custom network topology.
    
### 1. Define a Custom Topology
    
Create a file named `topology.edgelist` with the following content:
    
```
0 1
1 2
1 4
2 3
3 5
3 6
4 5
5 6
5 7
7 8
8 9
```
    
### 2. Configure `config.yaml`
    
Create or update your `config.yaml` to include the custom topology.
    
```yaml
simulations:
  simulation1:
    rounds: 5
    epochs: 2
    num_nodes: 10
    num_attackers: 2
    attacker_nodes: [3, 7]
    attacks: ['poison', 'delay']
    use_attackers: true
    participation_rate: 0.6
    topology: custom
    topology_file: topology.edgelist
    max_attacks: 3
    gossip_steps: 4
    protocol: gossip
    alpha: 0.5
    model_type: cnn
```
    
### 3. Run the Simulation
    
1. **Launch the Fenics Shell:**
    
    ```bash
    fenics
    ```
    
2. **Setup the Simulation Using `config.yaml`:**
    
    ```bash
    setup --config config.yaml --simulation_name simulation1
    ```
    
3. **Execute the Simulation:**
    
    ```bash
    run
    ```
    
4. **Monitor Outputs:**
    
    - **Logs:** Check the `results/simulation_log.txt` file for detailed logs.
    - **Plots:** Generated plots will be saved as PDF files in the `results` directory.
    - **Simulation Results:** Ensure that attacker nodes (3 and 7) perform their designated attacks, and observe how the network handles these adversarial behaviors.
