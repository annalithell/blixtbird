    decorator to register attack classes

    The reason for this is to avoid circular imports and to allow dynamic discovery of attack classes
    upon system runtime, this was made to replace ENUM CLASS in the past since Python Enums are evaluated 
    once at import time and arenâ€™t meant to mutate dynamically.
